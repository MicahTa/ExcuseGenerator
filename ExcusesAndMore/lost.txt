I didn't have it last
Someone else had it
It's not my job to keep track of it
Wasn't me
I never had it
It was on my night stand
The dog ate it
Ive just been under so much stress
I think someone might have taken it by mistake.
I've been really forgetful lately and must have misplaced it.
I've been so busy that I haven't had a chance to look for it.
I was in a rush this morning and must have left it somewhere.
I think it might have fallen out of my bag while I was walking.
I've been dealing with a lot of stress lately and it might have slipped my mind.
I'm not sure where I last had it - I'll have to retrace my step
I lent it to someone and forgot to ask for it back.
I think I might have accidentally thrown it away with some other things.
I gave it back
It must be in the couch cushins
My child took it and lost it
My dog ate it
My grandma died
