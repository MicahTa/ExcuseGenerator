I'm not feeling well and don't want to get anyone else sick.
I didn't realize the deadline was so soon.
I had a family obligation that I couldn't miss.
I had to deal with a personal crisis that prevented me from finishing on time.
I was waiting on input from someone else and they didn't provide it in time.
I misunderstood the requirements and had to start over.
I had technical difficulties that slowed me down.
That was today
My calander was wrong
I didn't know it was (day of the week)
