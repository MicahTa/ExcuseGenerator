I'm not feeling well and don't want to get anyone else sick.
Something unexpected came up and I have to take care of it.
I'm really busy with work right now and can't make it.
My car broke down and I can't make it there.
I forgot that I already had other plans that day.
I need to take care of something at home that can't wait.
I'm feeling really overwhelmed and need some time to myself.
My grandma died
My cat has went missing
I had a docters apointment
I got lost on the way here.
My child was sick this morning and I had to take care of them.
I lost track of time
I didn't know it was (day of the week)
That was today
My calander was wrong
My clock was off
I lost track of time
That was today
